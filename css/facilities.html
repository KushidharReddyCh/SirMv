     <em><p class="faci-text">Life in a hostel means a whole panorama of experiences that span from making 'friends for life',
        to gaining the confidence to face life independently.
        That is why we have laid a lot of emphasis in creating a warm, welcoming, invigorating and home-like atmosphere
         in our separate boys and girls hostels. At SIR MV PU, the hostel is a home away from home, where the children develop the confidence to be independent,
        be it friendships, food, belongings, rooms, joys,
        sorrows, challenges or any of the uncountable experiences of growing-up together.
        The SIR MV PU hostel has modern air-conditioned and refreshing buildings, built with the explicit purpose
         of offering a stimulating and enriching experience where students can learn to 'learn for life'.
          The caring and understanding support staff including housekeepers, matrons,
           ayahs, laundry and maintenance staff, wardens and of course the principal and teachers guide
            and pay special attention to the hostel students.</p></em>
